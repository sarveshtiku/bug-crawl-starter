# Bug Crawl Lab - Debugging Exercise

This project was completed as part of the CodePath SITE Summer Internship's Bug Crawl Lab. The goal was to identify and resolve common HTML and CSS layout issues using browser developer tools and validation services.

## Fixes Made - Minimum and Strech Goals Completed ðŸ¥³

### HTML
- Fixed improper nesting and missing closing tags
- Added semantic structure for clarity and maintainability
- Cleaned up indentation and structure for readability

### CSS
- Corrected box model issues with appropriate padding, margin, and borders
- Used Flexbox to align and distribute layout elements
- Overlaid text on images using absolute positioning within a relative container
- Adjusted image sizing for consistency and responsiveness
- Implemented responsive media queries to support small screens
- Built a multi-column footer using Flexbox with responsive wrap behavior

## Final Layout Preview

A screenshot of the final working version is shown below.

## Tools Used
- Visual Studio Code
- Chrome Developer Tools
- W3C HTML and CSS Validators

## Issues Encountered

One of the main challenges was figuring out how to size images consistently and control the spacing between them. Adjusting `width`, `max-width`, and margins required careful testing to avoid layout shifts, especially when overlaying text on top of images.

Getting the spacing right between feature items using Flexbox also took some trial and error, particularly balancing margins and responsive behavior.

## Application to Globetrotter Project

These debugging exercises helped reinforce how to effectively manage layout spacing, image scaling, and text overlays. For the Globetrotter travel guide project, this will help me better structure section spacing, align content cleanly, and present media elements with consistent size and positioning across screen sizes.
